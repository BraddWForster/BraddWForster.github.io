            <h3>Progressive tax theories: ability-to-pay</h3>
            <p>Taxes are collected to finance expenditure as well as reallocating resources and stabilising an economy.</p>
            <p>There are two approaches to taxation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>benefit principle</li>
                <li>ability-to-pay principle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The benefit principle says the each persons tax contributions should depend on the benefit they get from consuming the good provided by the government. An example of this is charging restaurants for using sidewalks for al fresco dining.</p>
            <p>Whereas, the ability-to-pay principle is based on equity and justice. It says that equals should be treated equally and unequals should be treated unequally (equity). It also tries to minimise a person's sacrefice from paying tax (justice). Many country's income tax system is based on the ability-to-pay principle.</p>
            <p>Below, I present two different kinds of an ability-to-pay tax.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Equal absolute sacrefice</li>
                <p>The equal absolute sacrefice means that both high and low-income individuals lose the same <b>abosulute amount</b> of utility from the tax.</p>
            </ul>
                <img id="image" src="images/absolute_tax.png" alt="Absolute tax."/>
            <ul>
                <li>Equal proportional sacrefice</li>
                <p>The equal proportional sacrefice means that both high and low-income individuals lose the same <b>proportion</b> of utility from the tax.</p>
            </ul>
            <img id="image" src="images/proportional_tax.png" alt="Proportional tax."/>

            <p>Under the equal proportional tax, the high-income person paid a higher share of the total tax than under the equal absolute tax. For the full analysis, see my Julia <u><a href="https://github.com/BraddWForster/tax_progressivity">code</a></u>.</p>

            <h3>Brexit blues</h3>
            <img id="image" src="images/brexit.jpg" alt="Crumbling bridge with people from Britain."/>
            <p>
                <b>Brexit's expected and unexpected effects</b> <br> <br>
                <b>It's been four years since Brexit.</b> <br>
                Enough time has passed to observe the short- to medium-term effects on the United Kingdom.<br>
                <b> The full extent of the cost is of great interest to politicians, economists, media, and the public.</b> <br>
                    Several London School of Economics Professors have taken it upon themselves to answer this question. <br>
                    Their work, suggests:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>sharp drop in both exports and imports with the EU for the average UK firm</li>
                <li>many exporters and importers stopped trading with the UK completely</li>                        
            </ul>
            <p>
